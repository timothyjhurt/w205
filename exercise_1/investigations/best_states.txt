What states are models of high-quality care?

The dataset hospitals.csv has state information and it has overall ratings which range
from 1 to 5. Because of this, I was able to solely use that dataset to answer this question. To do so, I aggregated all of the hospitals that scored either a 4 or a 5 for their overall rating. My logic in doing this is that a 4 and 5 are both above average and the higher percentage of hospitals a state has that are above average, the better that states' hospitals are. To calculate this percentage, I also needed information on how many hospitals every state has, so I aggregated the number of hospitals by state.

Using these two quantities, number above average hospitals by state and number of hospitals by state, I simply divided the first by the second to get the fraction of hospitals in a given state that are above average.

Here are the results from best to 10th best state:

State   Fraction of hospitals 
        within that state 
        that are above average
        in overall rating
