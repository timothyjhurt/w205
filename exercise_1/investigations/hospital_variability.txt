Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

The effective_care.csv files contains scores for different procedures at hospitals. To calculate the variability of different procedures across multiple hospitals, I created a query that calculates the standard deviation of the scores divided by the averages of the scores where the scores are grouped by procedures across all hospitals.  

Here is the result of the query in order from most to 10th most variable procedure across hospitals:
