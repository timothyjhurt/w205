What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures. 

This question has two parts and the second part assums the high scores on a variety of procedures is the equivalent to high quality care. While I agree that high scores on procedures are important, I also assert that high scores on readmissions, that is, not having to be re-emitted, and high overall scores which include patient feedback, are also important in determining whether or not a hospital provides high quality care.

In order to answer this question, with my assertions, I looked at the hospitals.csv and found multiple metrics that could be used to generate a ranking:

Hospital Overall Rating (0 to 5)
Mortality National Comparison Below, Same, or Above National Average
Safety National Comparison Below, Same, or Above National Average 
Readmissions National Comparison Below, Same, or Above National Average 
Patient Experience National Comparison Below, Same, or Above National Average 
Effectiveness National Comparison Below, Same, or Above National Average
Timeliness National Comparison Below, Same, or Above National Average   

However, when I queryed this data looking for hospitals that were above in every category and a 5 in overall rating, I ended up with 7 Hospitals, which is fewer than 10, and I had no way of knowing which hospital(s) should be number 8 as, the moment I relaxed any one of the conditions, my total number of hospitals went well above 10. 

To recitify this, I decided to not use Effectiveness, Timeliness, or Readmissions from hospitals.csv as the tables of readmissions and effective_care had scores related to these metrics rather than qualitative categorical rankings. 

So, I created multiple tables in order to:
Average the scores across all procedures for a given hospitals (effective care)
Average the scores across all readmissions and death scores for a given hospital
and joined these two tables with the hospitals.csv table where I only looked at hospitals that were "not below%" in patient experience, safety or mortality, and received a 5 in overall rating. 

This new table had two quantitative metrics (average effective score for the hospital across all procedures and average readmission score for the hospital) and I normalized them (by multiplying the readmissions score by 3.2 so that max(readmissions score)=max(effective score) and min(readmissions score)=min(effective score)) and summed them to get one final measure of overall care.

Below are the best 10 hospitals for overall care listed from best to tenth best:
